Introduction
The goal of this project is to classify Iris species using machine learning models. Two models are trained:

Support Vector Machine (SVM)
TensorFlow Neural Network
Dataset
The dataset used is the famous Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
There are three classes (species) in the dataset:

Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Models
SVM Model: A linear SVM classifier.
TensorFlow Model: A neural network with two hidden layers.
